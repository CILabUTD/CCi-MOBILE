% AudioFileProcessor
% GUI to processes audio files (.wav format)
% Processed stimuli is sent to the RF coils via USB/UART

This application performs ACE processing on the audio wave files with ‘.wav’ format. 
The audio signal acquired from mono/stereo file and is passed to ACE_Process.m for processing, which implements the basic ACE program. 
The complete signal is processed in one call (unlike real-time processing) and the processed stimuli is streamed to the board using function call Stream.m which is called inside stimulate.m file. 

Start by running AudioFileProcessor.m
You will be prompted to select a MAP file. Sample MAP files are provided in the MAPs folder under CCIMobile/MAPs/

Browse to the directory where the audio files are located. Select an audio file, and press the Stream button to start processing and streaming data. 
Sliders can be used to change gain levels. Use small increments when changing gain.
