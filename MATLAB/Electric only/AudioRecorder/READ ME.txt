These functions are used to record audio from the behind-the-ear
microphones (Cochlear Corp) or any additional microphones attached
through the audio ports of the board.

HOW TO USE AUDIO RECORDER 
  AudioRecorder allows you to record the incoming acoustic signals 
  from the   BTEs and stores the stereo acoustic signal in an audio file.
  Run AudioRecorder.m, GUI for Audio Recording will appear.
  Press the start button, to record the acoustic signals from the 
  BTEs bilaterally. Press the stop button to stop recording. An audio 
  (.wav) file will be created with name ‘BTEaudio.wav’ in the directory.
  Press the play button to play the captured audio from your PC’s 
  speakers. This application can also be used to check the 
  integrity of the audio signal as well as timing integrity of 
  real-time processing.
