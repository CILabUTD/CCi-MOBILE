Folder: 'AudioFileProcessor'
This folder allows the user to perform experimentation in an offline
manner by using a user-controlled GUI to select (.wav) tokens from
a user-specified directory to be streamed to the board and to the
cochlear implant user respectively. The GUI can only processes 
audio files (.wav format). The processed stimuli is sent to the 
RF coils via USB/UART commands within the 'CommonFunctions' folder.

HOW TO PERFORM OFFLINE PROCESSING:
  The audio signal acquired from mono/stereo file and is passed to 
  ACE_Process.m for processing, which implements the basic ACE program.
  If other signal processing is desired the custom button can be used
  to call individual signal processsing strategies. The program will 
  default to ACE. The complete signal is processed in one call 
  (unlike real-time processing) and the processed stimuli is 
  streamed to the board using function call Stream.m which is called 
  inside stimulate.m file. 

  Start by running AudioFileProcessor.m. You will be prompted to 
  select a MAP file. Sample MAP files are provided in the MAPs folder 
  under CCIMobile/MAPs/. Select a map file for your subject and a 
  GUI will be displayed.

  Browse to the directory where the audio files are located. Select 
  an audio file, and press the Stream button to start processing and 
  streaming data. Sliders can be used to change gain levels. Use small 
  increments when changing gain.

   LIST OF ITEMS in 'AudioFileProcessor.m'
   'ACE_Process.m'
	Description: This signal processing strategy (Cochlear Corp.)
	is an 'n-of-m' processing strategy stimulated through a
	continous-interleaving pattern (CIS). Signal processing is
	mimicked from the Nucleus MATLAB Tookbox (Cochlear Corp.)

   'AudioFileProcessor.fig'
	Description: To open, edit or view the GUI in MATLAB, execute
	'guide' in the command line and select the .fig file. This file
	can be edited, created, changed, and modified to specific
	needs of various speech and hearing research experiments. The
	default GUI includes a MAP check, a MAP title, the directory 
	of (.wav) files, three callback buttons, a strategy selection
	button, and sliders for gain variation

   'AudioFileProcessor.m'
	Description: To run offline processing, run 'AudioFileProcessor.m'
	which will request the user to select a MAP file before generating
	a GUI. All of the changes made to the (.fig) file should
	auto-populate into this program. Additional customization 
	(signal processing strategies, user-specified signal processing
	parameters, and additional functions) can be placed within the GUI
	framework here

   'AudioSignal.m'
	DescriptiOn: This program resamples the signal to be compatabile
	within the CCi-MOBILE software suite

   'S_01_01.wav'
	Description: This is a sample sentence from the IEEE Database
  
   'stimulate.m'
	Description: This function is used to stimulate the signal
	processing strategies (custom or ace)

   'Stream.m'
	Description: This function creates electric stimuli and sends the
	stimuli to the board for stimulation to the CI/HA user
