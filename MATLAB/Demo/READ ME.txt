% RealtimeStimulator DEMO
% GUI to visualize audio signal and processed stimuli (electrode stimulation profile) in realtime

The demo application RealtimeStimulator.m is for demonstration purposes only. 
The acoustic signal is acquired bilaterally (i.e., for both ears) and is passed to ACE_Processing_Realtime.m for subsequent processing. 
Incoming acoustic signal as well as resulting electrode activation profile can be visualized on the GUI. 
It is strongly advised not to use this application for any human testing because graphics may impact the real-time performance.

Start by running RealtimeStimulator.m
You will be prompted to select a MAP file. Sample MAP files are provided in the MAPs folder under CCIMobile/MAPs/ 
Select a map file for your subject and a GUI will appear.
Press the start button to start processing/streaming data. Speak close to the BTE for a visual demonstration of the incoming acoustic signal and resulting electrode activation profile. 
Sliders can be used to change sensitivity levels of microphones, gain, and volume levels. Press the stop button to finish.
