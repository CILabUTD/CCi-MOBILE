These functions are used to display the audio being captured
from the BTE microphones on the board.

HOW TO USE AUDIOSCOPE
  AudioScope is a simple application to visualize the incoming 
  acoustic signals from the BTEs. It displays the acoustic waveforms
  in real-time as they are captured. Run AudioScope.m, a GUI will 
  appear. On pressing the start button, acoustic signal waveform 
  will appear. This will run in real-time, similar to an 
  oscilloscope. Press the stop button to stop the process.
