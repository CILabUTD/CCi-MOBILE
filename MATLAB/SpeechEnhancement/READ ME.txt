WHAT TO UPDATE:
I have created a callback for all of the elements that need to be updated in the code. Each of the functions 
has a section to drop in code and to update the value.  
NOTE: For each function, the variable GUI_Val needs to be updated and assigned back to the app working variable.
To initialize your GUI/app, the names of each (.wav) files for each section () values need 
to be loaded into the following variables
 
	1. Set app.LoadSignalListBox.Items = () and 
	2. app.LoadListSignalBox.ItemsData 

The functions that need to be updated are:
- GeneratePlotButtonPushed - this is the code for when the Generate Plot button is pushed (line 45 of the code)
- LoadSelectionButtonPushed - this is when a selection from the populated listbox is chosen to load and use for 
	the demo(line 57)
- LoadCustomSelectionButtonPushed - this is when a selection not from the populated listbox is loaded to use for 
	the demo(line 71)
- NoiseSelectButtonGroupSelectionChanged- this is when a certain noise value is chosen out of the 3 to use (line 85)
- PlayORGButtonPushed- this is to play the original sample chosen (line 115)
- PlayNOISESampleButtonPushed- this is to play the noise sample (line 130)
- PlayNOISYButtonPushed- this is to play the original sample with the noise filter (line 145)
- PlaySESIGButtonPushed- this is to play the original sample with the noise filter and speech enhancement (line 160)
- SpectrogramCheckBoxValueChanged- this is checked to draw a sprectrogram on one of the plots 
  when the generate plot button is pushed (line 175)
- WaveformCheckBoxValueChanged- this is checked to draw a waveform on one of the plots 
  when the generate plot button is pushed (line 195)
- ElectrodogramCheckBoxValueChanged- this is checked to draw a electrodogram on one of the plots 
  when the generate plot button is pushed (line 205)
- ResetCheckBoxValueChanged- this is to reset all of the previous settings (line 220)
AGAIN: On all of these callbacks/functions, the variable GUI_Val needs to be updated.

Each of these functions/callbacks is structured as follows:

% -------------------------------------------------------- %
% Insert code when Random Button is Selected

(This is where you would insert your code)


% Assign value to 'GUI_Val'

(This is where you assign your value to the variable 'GUI_Val')
app.RandomButton.Value = GUI_Val;

% -------------------------------------------------------- %
