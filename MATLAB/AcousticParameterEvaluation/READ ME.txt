WHAT TO UPDATE
-To initialize your GUI/app, the names of each (.wav) files for each section (Spech, Music, Noise) values need 
to be loaded into the following variables		

		1. Set app.SpeechListBox = () 
		2. app.SpeechListBox.ItemsData
		3. Set app.MusicListBox = ()
		4. app.MusicListBox.ItemsData
		5. Set app.NoiseListBox = ()
		6. app.NoiseListBox.ItemsData

I have created a callback for all of the elements that need to be updated in the code. Each of the functions 
has a section to drop in code and to update the value.  
NOTE: For each function, the variable GUI_Val needs to be updated and assigned back to the app working variable.
- app.PlayAudioButton - the function is named PlayAudioButtonPushed (line 39)
- app.ViewElectrodogramButton - the function is named ViewElectrodogramButtonPushed (line 52)
- app.PerformanceSummaryButton - the function is named PerformanceSummaryButtonPushed (line 65)
- app.RealizabilityTestButton - the function is named RealizabilityTestButtonPushed (line 78)
- app.ProcessedParametersButton - the function is named ProcessedParametersButtonPushed (line 91)
- app.PerformanceSummaryButton_2 - the function is named PerformanceSummaryButton_2Pushed (line 104)
AGAIN: On all of these callbacks/functions, the variable GUI_Val needs to be updated.


Each of these functions/callbacks is structured as follows:

% -------------------------------------------------------- %
% Insert code when Random Button is Selected

(This is where you would insert your code)


% Assign value to 'GUI_Val'

(This is where you assign your value to the variable 'GUI_Val')
app.RandomButton.Value = GUI_Val;

% -------------------------------------------------------- %
